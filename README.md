# Sapere Aude ğŸ’¡

  *To the skill that scales*
  
  *the epitome of elegance;*
  
  *To the craft that craves*
  
  *the artistry of an artist, I say,*
  
  **Sapere Aude ğŸ’¡ Sapere Aude ğŸ’¡**
  
  <br>
  
  *To the mark that matches*
  
  *the target of triumph;*
  
  *To the cat that catches*
  
  *the conundrums of clients, I say,*
  
  **Sapere Aude ğŸ’¡ Sapere Aude ğŸ’¡**
  
  <br>
  
  *To the mire that murks*
  
  *the nuggets of nuance;*
  
  *To the flags that furl*
  
  *the serendipity in stacks, I say,*
  
  **Sapere Aude ğŸ’¡ Sapere Aude ğŸ’¡**
  
  <br>
  
  *To the bugs that bite*
  
  *the dismay of debuggers;*
  
  *To the errors that eclipse*
  
  *the disdain of developers, I say,*
  
  **Sapere Aude ğŸ’¡ Sapere Aude ğŸ’¡**
